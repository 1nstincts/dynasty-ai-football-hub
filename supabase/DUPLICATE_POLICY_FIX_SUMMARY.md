# Duplicate Policy Fix - Summary Documentation

This document provides a comprehensive overview of the process to identify, fix, and verify the resolution of duplicate Row Level Security (RLS) policies in the Supabase database for the Dynasty AI Football Hub application.

## Problem Background

Duplicate RLS policies were detected on multiple tables in the application:

1. `players` table: Duplicate policies for the policy named "Enable read access for all users"
2. `team_rosters` table: Multiple permissive policies for role `anon` for action `SELECT`, specifically {"Allow all to manage team rosters","Allow all to read team rosters"}

These duplicate policies caused performance issues because Supabase must execute multiple policies for every query, and potentially created unpredictable behavior in data access patterns.

## Solution Process

### 1. Identification and Analysis

- Examined existing policies on the `players` table
- Confirmed duplicate policies existed with identical names
- Analyzed the potential impact of removing duplicates

### 2. Fix Implementation

Created a SQL script (`fix_duplicate_policy.sql`) that:
- Identifies all duplicate policies
- Selectively removes duplicates while preserving one instance
- Uses a safe approach to avoid disrupting data access

The script implementation uses:
- System catalog queries to identify policies
- Transaction blocks to ensure atomic operations
- Conditional checks to prevent errors

### 3. Alternative Fix Methods

Provided multiple methods for applying the fix:
- Running the SQL script directly
- Using Supabase Studio UI
- Using Supabase CLI

### 4. Verification Process

Created verification tools:
- SQL script (`verify_policy_removal.sql`) to check policy status
- Node.js utility (`verify-policy-removal.mjs`) for programmatic verification
- Documentation for manual verification steps

### 5. Success Criteria

The fix is considered successful when:
- Only one instance of each uniquely named policy exists
- No duplicate entries appear in `pg_policies` for the same policy name
- Application functionality works correctly with the revised policies

| `supabase/fix_duplicate_policy.sql` | SQL script to remove duplicate policies on players table |
| `supabase/fix_team_rosters_policy.sql` | SQL script to fix team_rosters table policies |
| `supabase/README_FIX_POLICIES.md` | Instructions for applying the fixes |
| `supabase/verify_policy_removal.sql` | SQL queries to verify fix success for all tables |
| `supabase/VERIFY_POLICY_INSTRUCTIONS.md` | Detailed verification instructions |

## Running the Fix

The fix should be applied in the following order:

1. **Backup**: Always create a database backup before applying fixes
2. **Fix**: Run the `fix_duplicate_policy.sql` script using one of the provided methods
3. **Verify**: Execute the verification script to confirm the fix worked
4. **Test**: Test application functionality to ensure data access works correctly

## Potential Issues

- If the application relies on specific policy IDs, removing policies could affect functionality
- The fix assumes that duplicate policies are functionally identical
- There may be edge cases where duplicate policies were intentionally created

## Preventative Measures

To prevent this issue in the future:
- Add validation in your CI/CD pipeline to detect duplicate policies
- Use explicit policy names in all RLS policy creation scripts
- Consider implementing a policy management system for larger applications

## Support

If issues persist after applying the fix:
1. Review the error logs
2. Check the verification results
3. Consider contacting Supabase support for additional assistance
